## :star: Stage of the project:
- [x] `Initialize the app with basic content`

- [ ] Implement a canvas element and basic update & draw system 

- [ ] Implement algorithm mechanics 

- [ ] Add interactivity with objects (nodes & connections)

- [ ] Add user-interactive interface

- [ ] Add responsiveness for mobile devices
 
## :thumbsup: Nice-to-have features:
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Responsive design for most devices
- [ ] User-friendly design
